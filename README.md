# X-Y-Plotting-Bot
A lab project that has since been improved.

For one of my lab courses we were tasked with creating our own personalized project. I decided to go with creating an X-Y Plotting Robot after seeing how motor control worked in one of our previous labs. The code works on the TI MSP-430 microcontroller, using Code Composer Studio. Pin connections are clearly commented in the code and there are handy functions to allow users to customize the program to generate their own drawings.
